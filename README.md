# GameJam
My first game in Java made in one week, with only four weeks of experience. This game is inspired by the classic game pacman, implementing the theme of my bootcamp with the classroom for the game map, our computers to be destroyed by the bug and our code masters as ghosts, trying to capture the bug!
