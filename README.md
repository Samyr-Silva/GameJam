## BUGMAN

About the Project
BUGMAN is my first game developed in Java, created in just one week with only four weeks of programming experience. This game is inspired by the classic Pac-Man, but with a unique twist:
The game map represents our classroom.
The computers are the Bug's targets, which need to be destroyed.
The code masters are the "ghosts," trying to capture the Bug before it completes its mission!

##

## Features
The game includes the following features:

Precise ghost movement: Intelligent behavior implementation to chase the player.

Timer: A time system that challenges the player to complete the objective before time runs out.

##

## How to Play
Control the Bug around the map.

Destroy the computers before the code master "ghosts" catch you.

Complete your mission before time runs out!
